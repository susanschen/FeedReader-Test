# Project Overview

This project demonstrates the value of a "test-driven development" process.  The original [project assets](http://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader) contains a pre-existing feedreader application and an incomplete JavaScript specification file that must be completed by the student.

## Testing Framework 

[Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) is used as the framework for testing the feedreader app.

## How to Run the Applicaiton

It's easy! Simply download the git repository and open index.html. That's it!  Jasmine does all the testing automatically and displays the results at the bottom of the webpage.

Here's a screenshot of the Jasmine test results.
